### Database Design
- Create a list of data items that will be stored in your project. For example, in
library project, you may ask the library.
- Find and list all entities.
- Find the attributes of entities (the attributes are data items that you already
found)
- Define data types and restrictions for each attribute (e.g. Number of digits in
student ID, range of values for Age attribute, ...)
- Define relationships between entities and their types (Explain how you found
the type of the relationships)
- Create Entity-Relation (ER) model of your database.
- Create necessary tables for your database.
- Show in which normal forms your tables are.


### Application design & development
- Design necessary queries based on the requirements of the project
- Write necessary SQL commands to create tables and queries
- Write a report for your project (put all steps explained above)
- Implement your project using a DBMS (Oracle, MS-SQL, MySQL, MS-Access,
...)
*** at least 10 tables and 10 SQL queries with some Type 1 and Type 2 queries *****
